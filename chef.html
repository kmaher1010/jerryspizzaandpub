        <h2>Chef Jerry's Bio</h2>

        <p>
            Jerry's started making pizza as a teenager catering local parties perfecting his recipe along the way. Jerry
            went to chef school after high school. After chef school Jerry's took a job a famous Italian restaurant for
            a few years. When Jerry saved enough money to start his own place, Jerry's Pizza and Pub was established.
        </p>
        <p>
            Jerry attended Italiano Perfecto Chef school after high school. Jerry was formally taught the nuances with
            creating Italian dishes to perfection. While Jerry already makes a fantastic Pizza, he was able to tweak his
            recipe even more. He also learned how to make a variety of Italian dishes to perfection. Jerry's chicken
            parmesan is well liked along with his gnocchi with Italian sausage.
        </p>
        <p>
            Jerry finished Italiano Perfecto Chef school at the top of his class. He won the exclusive Meatball Perfecto
            award for the best meatball ever made at the school. Jerry's school frequently invites him to give speeches
            to graduation classes.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2010, Jerry attended the all-valley cookoff. The cookoff consisted of three qualifying rounds where Jerry
            was required to create different dishes for each one to qualify for the next. Once you progress through all
            three rounds, the remaining three chefs then enter the final round where they present their best dish. While
            Jerry made the final round, he was kidnapped by an unknown chef and held until the cookoff was over.
            Unfortunately, Jerry had to forfeit the final round.
